Four healthy adults who signed a consent form were scanned.

DATA ACQUISITION

We performed human experiments on a Siemens Magnetom 10.5 T MR scanner (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) retrofitted with 16-channel RF transmission and 128-channel signal reception systems, and equipped with a whole-body gradient (70 mT/m maximum strength and 200 T/m/s maximum slew rate). A custom-built 16Tx80Rx RF head array, with an FDA-approved investigational device exemption, was used to acquire human brain images. The same human volunteers were scanned at 7 T on a Siemens Terra MR scanner (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany), using the commercial Nova single-channel transmit 32-channel receive RF coil (Nova Medical, Wilmington, MA, USA).

At 10.5 T, a 3D ME-GRE sequence with embedded volumetric navigators was used for T2*w data acquisition. Relevant imaging parameters included 0.5 mm isotropic resolution, 240×180×128 mm3 field of view (FOV), 35 ms repetition time (TR), 4 echo times (TEs), TE1 of 10.2 ms, echo spacing (ES) of 4.9 ms, 12° nominal flip angle (i.e., the Ernst angle assuming T1 of 1.75 s for the mean value across gray and white matter at 10.5 T33) and 208 Hz/pixel readout receiver bandwidth. Parallel imaging with controlled aliasing (CAIPI) was applied with an acceleration factor of 2 in the phase-encoding (left-right) direction and 3 in the slice-encoding (head-foot) direction, leading to a total scan time of ~13.3 min.

At 7 T, T2* w data acquisition was performed using the same 3D ME-GRE sequence as the 10.5 T experiments. Imaging parameters including FOV, resolution, 2D acceleration, TE1 and ES were matched to the 10.5 T protocol. Due to the longer T2* values, the 7 T data acquisition employed a 6-echo protocol, leading to a longer TR of 45 ms, a higher nominal flip angle of 14° (using mean 7 T T1 of 1.5 s), and a longer total scan time of ~17.2 min. The volumetric navigator images were collected using the same imaging parameters as those of the 10.5 T protocol, except that their temporal resolution increased to 540 ms due to the increased TR.

For each volunteer, we acquired fully sampled calibration data in a separate reference scan using a multi-echo 2D GRE sequence. This data was used for estimating multi-coil sensitivity maps needed for parallel image reconstruction. Specifically, multi-slice 2D GRE images with whole brain coverage were obtained with the following parameters: 4 mm isotropic in-plane resolution, 256×192 mm2 FOV, 4 mm slice thickness and 50 axial slices. At each field strength, TE was set to the minimum water-fat in-phase TE, 2.56 ms for 10.5 T and 2.88 ms for 7 T, for improved sensitivity map estimation. TR was set to 315 ms for 10.5 T and 500 ms for 7 T, and nominal flip angle to 30° for 10.5 T and 38° for 7 T, leading to a total scan time of less than 25 s.

For image processing and analysis, whole-brain anatomical reference images were collected using T1-weighted (T1w) 3D magnetization prepared two rapid acquisition gradient echoes (MP2RAGE) at 7 T. MP2RAGE parameters included 0.7 mm isotropic resolution, 2.36 ms TE, 4 s TR, and TI1/TI2= 740/2430 ms.

All 3D T2*w ME-GRE images were reconstructed using in-house MATLAB software made publicly available at https://github.com/jiaen-liu/moco. The reconstruction was based on a unified signal model incorporating intra-scan rigid-body motion and B0 changes for motion and B0 correction, and coil sensitivity maps for SENSE-based parallel imaging reconstruction.
